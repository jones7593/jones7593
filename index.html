    <h3> Chef's Knife </h3> 
    <p> This is one of the most important kitchen tools.  A sharp, high-quality chef's knife will allow you more efficiency, precision, and safety when cutting vegtables.</p> 

    <p>Be sure to keep it sharpened: invest in a knife sharpener or take it to a professional.</p>

    <h3> Paring Knife </h3>
   <p> Old-school cooks can use a paring knife like a boss.  My nana uses one to hand-dice onions, potatoes, celery and just about everything else - no cutting board required.</p>

   <p> If you feel comfortable using a chef's knife for exact cuts, then this knife may not be necessary.</p>
