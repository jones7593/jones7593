<p><strong>Student Housing Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>First year students have priority.</p>
<p>Two thirds of our first year students will receive accomodations.</p>
<p>Upper class students are not guaranteed housing, due to limited space. </p>
<p>It is important for students to take housing limitations into account when planning their college experience.  It is important for students to recognize that they are likely to begin living off-campus as early as their second year.</p>
